            <p>Long ago, the forest learned how to celebrate.<br/>When rain meets sunlight, colors awaken the trees and hidden paths begin
            to glow.<br/>
            This is where Ellen’s story unfolds — a place shaped by folklore, laughter, and the belief that good fortune follows
            those who walk with an open heart.<br/>
            The forest keeps its secrets close - you gotta poke around and actually spend time there to find the really cool stuff.</p>
